    description: "The first-generation Porsche Cayman (987) was introduced as a coupe companion to the second-generation Boxster, positioned between the Boxster and 911 in Porsche's lineup. Based on the Boxster's architecture but with added structural rigidity from its fixed roof, the Cayman offered enhanced handling dynamics. Initially available as the Cayman S with a 3.4-liter flat-six producing 295 horsepower, a base model with a 2.7-liter 245-horsepower engine was added in 2007. In 2009, as part of the 987.2 update, both engines received direct fuel injection, boosting power to 265 horsepower in the base model and 320 horsepower in the S. Transmission options included a five or six-speed manual, or Porsche's new PDK dual-clutch automatic from 2009. The interior was shared with the Boxster, featuring traditional Porsche styling cues and high-quality materials. A limited-production Cayman R was introduced in 2011 as a lightweight, performance-focused variant with 330 horsepower, reduced sound insulation, and optional deletion of air conditioning and radio. The first-generation Cayman established the model's reputation for exceptional balance and handling precision, with many enthusiasts and reviewers considering it the purest expression of Porsche's sports car philosophy."

  - name: "Second Generation (981)"
    start_year: 2013
    end_year: 2016
    description: "The second-generation Cayman (981) represented a more comprehensive redesign, featuring a new lightweight body structure with extensive use of aluminum, resulting in a 66-pound weight reduction despite slightly larger dimensions. The chassis rigidity increased by 40%, further enhancing the Cayman's already exceptional handling. The standard Cayman featured a 2.7-liter flat-six producing 275 horsepower, while the Cayman S employed a 3.4-liter flat-six with 325 horsepower. The Cayman GTS, introduced in 2014, extracted 340 horsepower from the 3.4-liter powerplant. All were available with either a six-speed manual or seven-speed PDK dual-clutch transmission. The crowning achievement of the 981 generation was the Cayman GT4, which utilized a 3.8-liter engine derived from the 911 Carrera S producing 385 horsepower, paired exclusively with a six-speed manual transmission. The GT4 also featured aggressive aerodynamics and suspension components shared with the 911 GT3. The exterior design became more aggressive and sculptural, with larger side air intakes and a more distinctive stance, while the interior quality was significantly upgraded with a design influenced by the Panamera. The 981 Cayman was widely praised for its dynamic excellence, with many reviewers considering it among the best-handling cars available at any price. This generation represented the pinnacle of the naturally aspirated flat-six Cayman before the transition to turbocharged four-cylinder engines in the succeeding 718 generation."

  - name: "Third Generation (982/718)"
    start_year: 2016
    end_year: null
    description: "The third and current generation Cayman adopted the 718 nomenclature, paying homage to Porsche's successful four-cylinder racing cars from the 1950s and 1960s. This name change signaled the most significant powertrain shift in the model's history: replacing the naturally aspirated flat-six engines with turbocharged flat-four engines. The base 718 Cayman features a 2.0-liter turbocharged flat-four producing 300 horsepower, while the S model uses a 2.5-liter turbocharged flat-four with 350 horsepower. The GTS initially used an uprated version of the 2.5-liter engine with 365 horsepower before reverting to a naturally aspirated 4.0-liter flat-six with 394 horsepower in 2020. The track-focused GT4 also features a naturally aspirated 4.0-liter flat-six producing 414 horsepower. The GT4 RS, introduced in 2022, uses a modified version of the GT3's 4.0-liter flat-six, producing 493 horsepower. While the switch to four-cylinder engines improved torque, acceleration figures, and fuel efficiency, some enthusiasts criticized the change in engine character and sound. Visually, the 718 Cayman features more angular styling with revised front and rear designs, while the interior received updated technology including Porsche's latest infotainment system. Despite the controversial powertrain change, the 718 Cayman maintains the model's reputation for exceptional handling balance, precise steering, and driver engagement."
